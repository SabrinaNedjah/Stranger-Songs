    <p class="letsplay_paragr">Immerse yourself in a musical experience</p>
    <p class="letsplay_paragr">Start playing and creating your own track that you can customise from A to Z !</p>
    <p class="letsplay_paragr">First you will have to choose what type of ambience you want and then you can start playing ! You can play the drumkit directly with your keyboard. Every key makes a different sound.</p>
    <p class="letsplay_paragr">Your keyboard will be separated in five different parts that you will immediately recognise by their color. Then, all you have to do is play and record your song.</p>
    <p class="letsplay_paragr red"><span>Warning !</span> Some samples (like melodies) can be longer than others, so be careful and take your time.</p>
